## ✅ Done

- [x] Multi-module Maven project scaffolded (`job-portal-system` parent pom)
    - Modules: `cloud`, `common-lib`, `services`
- [x] Parent POM configured: Java 21, Spring Boot 4.1.1, Spring Cloud 2025.1.0
- [x] `job-portal-cloud` module created (pom only, no services yet)
- [x] `job-portal-common` module created with validation, lombok, jackson-annotations deps
- [x] `job-portal-service` (services) parent module created
- [x] `job-portal-user-service` module created with JPA, Web, Postgres, Lombok deps
- [x] `HomeController` created with a working `GET /` → returns `"Hello World"`
- [x] `application.yaml` present in `job-portal-user-service`

## 🟡 In Progress

- [ ] Fixing dependency issues in `job-portal-user-service/pom.xml`:
    - `spring-boot-starter-webmvc` → should be `spring-boot-starter-web`
    - `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa-test` / `spring-boot-starter-webmvc-test` → should be `spring-boot-starter-test`
- [ ] Fixing `jib.maven.plugin` artifactId → should be `jib-maven-plugin` (in parent pom pluginManagement)

## 🗒️ Dev Log

### 2026-09-04
- Reviewed initial project structure (screenshot shared).
- Confirmed `HomeController` returns "Hello World" successfully — base Spring Boot app runs.
- Identified and fixed pom.xml dependency naming issues across modules (`spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-test`, `jib-maven-plugin`).
- Fixed folder/artifactId naming consistency, added `.gitignore`.
- Created `README.md` and `progress.md` to track architecture & tasks going forward.
